                    <p>
                        Developed by Aziz “Hax$” Al-Yami between 2016 and 2020, the B0XX is an
                        ergonomic alternative to the Nintendo Gamecube controller primarily
                        intended for <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>, but also compatible with other titles.
                        With its all-digital interface, the B0XX allows <em>Melee</em> enthusiasts to enjoy
                        their favorite video game while preserving their hand health.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a software level, the B0XX is thoroughly optimized with two goals in
                        mind: game balance and efficiency. The former goal refers to the fact that the
                        B0XX has been designed around the Gamecube controller, rather than with
                        the intention of superseding the Gamecube controller as a viable option for
                        competitors. Certain in-game techniques within <em>Melee</em> have deliberately been
                        weakened or excluded from the B0XX in order to match the “strength” of the
                        Gamecube controller as closely as possible with an otherwise superior input
                        method. Efficiency, the latter goal, refers to the fact that a high quality of life
                        has been emphasized across the board: the B0XX’s button layout is ideal for
                        the arsenal of techniques available within <em>Melee</em>, while the act of aiming the
                        B0XX’s analog directions has been made as intuitive as can be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, the B0XX is legal at <em>Melee's</em> most prestigious international events,
                        including <em>Genesis, The Big House, Super Smash Con, Get On My Level,
                        Shine,</em> and more. We hope that as the competitive <em>Melee</em> scene continues to
                        evolve, the B0XX goes on to be a testament to the game’s legacy and the love
                        we share for it.

                    <p>
                        The B0XX’s Left, Down, and Right buttons are assigned to the middle three
                        fingers on your left hand to allow for precise control of your character. L, the
                        B0XX’s primary shield trigger, is assigned to your left hand as well. This
                        allows you to comfortably perform out-of-shield actions such as aerial attacks
                        and wavedashes with your right hand. Finally, Up, <em>Melee's</em> least important
                        analog direction, is assigned to your right pinky finger as to be accessible at
                        all times (without having to adjust your left hand).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Continuing with the right half of the controller, the B and R buttons are each
                        paired with a jump button (X and Y respectively) so that airborne special
                        moves (X → B) and wavedashes (Y → R) can be performed swiftly. Z,
                        which is useful for L-cancelling and grabbing, rounds out the home row of
                        buttons, while lightshield and midshield round out the top row. The A button
                        and the 4 C-stick directions are then situated next to each other so that all 5
                        aerial attacks feel similar to perform (X → A or C).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, Modifier X and Modifier Y, which allow for advanced directional
                        control, will be explained in Chapter 5.

                        For the sake of comfort and/or efficiency, it is recommended (or in some
                        cases, required) that the following in-game techniques are performed using
                        specific button inputs on the B0XX:

                    <p><sub>
                        *Wavedashing with R is recommended because of the strength provided by
                        the index finger, while airdodging upwards with L is recommended because
                        Up isn’t on the same row of buttons as R.

                    <p>
                        Since the B0XX does not have access to every coordinate on a Gamecube
                        controller’s analog stick, a basic overview of the coordinate plane will be
                        helpful for understanding why the coordinates on this controller were chosen.
                        The above diagram showcases the 9 sections of the coordinate plane (dead
                        zone, 4 cardinals, 4 quadrants), as well as the minimum/maximum cardinal
                        vectors and the minimum/maximum 45 degree vectors.

                        Along the X and Y-axes, there are [different] cut-offs that separate “Tilt”
                        territory from “Smash” territory. The differences between these territories are
                        not limited to Tilt and Smash attacks, but also actions such as Walk/Dash
                        along the X-axis and Tap Jump/Shield Drop along the Y-axis. X .8000 and
                        Y .6625, the first values that activate Smash on either axis, are pictured
                        above.

                        Within the quadrants, there is a 50° Line that distinguishes various actions.
                        Most notably, < 50° territory is useful for angled F-tilt and getting up from
                        the ledge, while > 50° territory is useful for turnaround U-tilt/D-tilt and
                        falling from the ledge.

                    <p>
                        The B0XX handles opposite cardinal inputs (i.e. Left → Right) by overriding
                        the previously held direction with the newly chosen direction. It is crucial
                        that the B0XX’s analog stick behaves as such, as this allows the B0XX user
                        to dash-dance (dash left and right quickly) without having to worry about
                        newly chosen directions not being registered.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If, however, opposite cardinal inputs are held simultaneously and the most
                        recently chosen direction is released (i.e. Left → Right → release Right), the
                        original direction will <strong>not</strong> reactivate. This system is intended to most closely
                        resemble the act of releasing a Gamecube controller’s analog stick, which
                        would cause it to return to its centerpoint, not the opposite cardinal direction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The behavior described within this section applies to the B0XX’s C-stick

                        Modifier buttons are akin to Shift keys on a keyboard; on their own, modifier
                        buttons won’t produce any inputs, but in conjunction with the 4 analog stick
                        directions, they will adjust your inputs from the ones shown in Section 4.1.

                        When held in conjunction with a horizontal cardinal input, Modifier X will
                        shift you from X 1.0 to X .6625. This coordinate is useful for performing
                        <strong>Walk and F-tilt.</strong> X .6625 also serves as a <strong>slight DI</strong> option for when you are
                        thrown vertically by your opponent.

                        performing <strong>U-tilt and D-tilt.</strong>

                        <strong>angled F-tilt.</strong> These coordinates also double as <strong>the shallowest Firefox angle
                        on the B0XX,</strong> which will be elaborated on in Section 6.1.

                        quadrants.</strong> By pinpointing X .3125 Y .7375, Modifier Y allows you to
                        perform <strong>turnaround U-tilt, but only in buffered situations</strong> such as L-

                        Y .7375 prior to buffering these coordinates, you will perform a U-smash).
                        Additionally, these coordinates form a 67° angle, which can be used to

                        adjust these to 30.5° and 59.5° respectively.</strong> This deliberate nerf is intended
                        to simulate the increased difficulty a Gamecube controller user faces in
                        airdodging steeply (as compared to up-B’ing steeply) due to the smaller

                        were finalized on the basis of promoting healthy ledge-dash behavior across
                        the cast, as well as being reasonably reliable angles to pinpoint when

                    <p>
                        In Chapter 5, an inconspicuous, but crucial feature was listed: Modifier X and
                        Y’s refusal to modify horizontal analog stick inputs <em>when Left and Right are
                        held simultaneously.</em>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This feature was implemented in order to optimize a single in-game scenario:
                        <strong>ledge-dashing.</strong> During a ledge-dash, the <strong>jump trajectory</strong> registered on your
                        character’s mid-air jump frame contributes to not only the overall distance
                        your character travels, but in some cases, whether the ledge-dash succeeds or
                        fails altogether! By retaining the best possible jump trajectory value of X 1.0
                        when both horizontal cardinals are held, Modifiers X and Y allow you to
                        ledge-dash at different airdodge angles <em>without</em> arbitrarily stunting your mid-
                        air jump. <strong>This is particularly useful when you use Back to fall from the
                        ledge, followed by Forward + Jump.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>Without this feature:</em> Hold Modifier X → Back (X -.6625) → Forward +
                        Jump (X .6625) → Down-forward + Airdodge
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>With this feature:</em> Hold Modifier X → Back (X -.6625) → <strong>Forward + Jump
                        (X 1.0)</strong> → Down-forward + Airdodge

                        45° angle. <strong>Instead, they give a steeper angle that is intended to be used to
                        ASDI diagonally and perform slide-offs during specific frames of tech
                        roll and get-up roll that cause your character’s ECB (environmental
                        collision box) to shift to the side of the platform.</strong> In order to perform this                   
                        technique, shift your right hand down to the C-stick buttons and hold C-
                        Down with your thumb in addition to either C-left with your index finger or                  
                        C-right with your ring finger.

                        The B0XX is compatible with the Nintendo Wii Nunchuk (sold separately).
                        Once plugged in, the Nunchuk will cause the B0XX to hot-swap into
                        <em>Nunchuk Mode,</em> during which the 4 analog stick directions, Modifier X and Y,
                        and L are disabled. The Nunchuk’s Z button (large button) then behaves as L.
                        <em>Nunchuk Mode</em> allows Gamecube controller users to enjoy the B0XX’s
                        improved button layout while retaining the analog stick control they are
                        familiar with.

                        Throughout this document, the controller presented to you was deliberately
                        stripped of its ability to perform certain techniques within <em>Super Smash Bros.
                        Melee</em> in order to create a fair gameplay experience. These techniques, which
                        require extreme precision to perform with a Gamecube controller, include:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The B0XX’s inability to perform the techniques listed above should have no
                        effect on your in-game decisions so long as you are aware that these
                        techniques are not present on the controller. There are, however, a few
                        additional restrictions on the B0XX that have not yet been documented. This
                        chapter will cover them.

                        Normally, Modifier Y + Horizontal (X .3375) is located in neutral-B territory.
                        While the slight DI option offered by this coordinate is a healthy addition to
                        the B0XX, its ability to guarantee a turnaround → neutral-B (without
                        incurring the risk of an accidental side-B) is not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In order to prevent this exploit, Modifier Y + Horizontal is modified to X 1.0
                        when the B button is held. <strong>This forces the B0XX user to “flick” the analog
                        stick by quickly pressing, then releasing a horizontal direction in order
                        to perform a turnaround neutral-B.</strong>

                    <img class="imgSquare" src="images/9.2CaptureSquare.png" alt="Smash DI Coordinates Example" type="image/png">
                    <p>
                        On a Gamecube controller, the go-to method for smash DI is “quarter-circle
                        smash DI,” which involves pointing the analog stick in a cardinal direction
                        followed by an adjacent diagonal direction in order to register 2 smash DI
                        inputs. Due to digital inputs’ lack of physical recoil, however, the B0XX is
                        normally at the advantage of being able to attempt a 3rd smash DI input.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In order to level the playing field, <strong>the B0XX is programmed to recognize a
                        quarter-circle motion on the analog stick and outlaw the correct diagonal
                        direction to go to next for 4 frames in response.</strong> For example:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="greenLiText"><em>Frame 1:</em> Right (SDI)</li>
                        <li class="greenLiText"><em>Frame 2:</em> Up + Right (SDI)</li>
                        <li class="redLiText"><em>Frame 3:</em> Down + Right is outlawed</li>
                        <li class="redLiText"><em>Frame 4:</em> Down + Right is outlawed</li>
                        <li class="redLiText"><em>Frame 5:</em> Down + Right is outlawed</li>
                        <li class="redLiText"><em>Frame 6:</em> Down + Right is outlawed</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        For clarification, an attempt to input Down + Right during frames 3-6 results
                        in a null input (the analog stick would remain in Up + Right in this case).:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>Note:</em> The B0XX’s smash DI nerf will never conflict with any other area of
                        the game, as the double quarter-circle motion it outlaws is not required to
                        perform any traditional techniques.

                        On a Gamecube controller, performing vertical tilts shortly after pivoting is

                        accordance with this shortcoming, the B0XX is programmed to deny pivot U/
                        UF-tilt attempts for 9 frames and pivot D/DF-tilt attempts for 4 frames.
                    </p>
