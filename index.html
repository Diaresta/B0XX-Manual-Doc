                    Developed by Aziz “Hax$” Al-Yami between 2016 and 2020, the B0XX is an
                    ergonomic alternative to the Nintendo Gamecube controller primarily
                    intended for <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>, but also compatible with other titles.
                    With its all-digital interface, the B0XX allows <em>Melee</em> enthusiasts to enjoy
                    their favorite video game while preserving their hand health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a software level, the B0XX is thoroughly optimized with two goals in
                    mind: game balance and efficiency. The former goal refers to the fact that the
                    B0XX has been designed around the Gamecube controller, rather than with
                    the intention of superseding the Gamecube controller as a viable option for
                    competitors. Certain in-game techniques within <em>Melee</em> have deliberately been
                    weakened or excluded from the B0XX in order to match the “strength” of the
                    Gamecube controller as closely as possible with an otherwise superior input
                    method. Efficiency, the latter goal, refers to the fact that a high quality of life
                    has been emphasized across the board: the B0XX’s button layout is ideal for
                    the arsenal of techniques available within <em>Melee</em>, while the act of aiming the
                    B0XX’s analog directions has been made as intuitive as can be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, the B0XX is legal at <em>Melee's</em> most prestigious international events,
                    including <em>Genesis, The Big House, Super Smash Con, Get On My Level,
                    Shine,</em> and more. We hope that as the competitive <em>Melee</em> scene continues to
                    evolve, the B0XX goes on to be a testament to the game’s legacy and the love
                    we share for it.

                <h2>2.1. Button Layout</h2>
                <img>
                <p>
                    The B0XX’s Left, Down, and Right buttons are assigned to the middle three
                    fingers on your left hand to allow for precise control of your character. L, the
                    B0XX’s primary shield trigger, is assigned to your left hand as well. This
                    allows you to comfortably perform out-of-shield actions such as aerial attacks
                    and wavedashes with your right hand. Finally, Up, <em>Melee's</em> least important
                    analog direction, is assigned to your right pinky finger as to be accessible at
                    all times (without having to adjust your left hand).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Continuing with the right half of the controller, the B and R buttons are each
                    paired with a jump button (X and Y respectively) so that airborne special
                    moves (X → B) and wavedashes (Y → R) can be performed swiftly. Z,
                    which is useful for L-cancelling and grabbing, rounds out the home row of
                    buttons, while lightshield and midshield round out the top row. The A button
                    and the 4 C-stick directions are then situated next to each other so that all 5
                    aerial attacks feel similar to perform (X → A or C).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, Modifier X and Modifier Y, which allow for advanced directional
                    control, will be explained in Chapter 5.

                <img>
                <p>
                    For the sake of comfort and/or efficiency, it is recommended (or in some
                    cases, required) that the following in-game techniques are performed using
                    specific button inputs on the B0XX:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aerial Attacks: X → A or C</li>
                    <li>Airborne Special Moves: X → B</li>
                    <li>Jump-Cancel Grab: X → Z or Up → Z</li>
                    <li>L-Cancel: Z</li>
                    <li>Tech: L</li>
                    <li>Wall-Jump Tech: X or Up→ L</li>
                    <li>Wavedash*: Y → R</li>
                    <li>Airdodge Upwards*: L</li>
                    <li>Shield: L</li>
                    <li>Shield Tilt: L + Modifier X</li>
                </ul>
                <p><sub>
                    *Wavedashing with R is recommended because of the strength provided by
                    the index finger, while airdodging upwards with L is recommended because
                    Up isn’t on the same row of buttons as R.

            <article>
                <img>
                <p>
                    Since the B0XX does not have access to every coordinate on a Gamecube
                    controller’s analog stick, a basic overview of the coordinate plane will be
                    helpful for understanding why the coordinates on this controller were chosen.
                    The above diagram showcases the 9 sections of the coordinate plane (dead
                    zone, 4 cardinals, 4 quadrants), as well as the minimum/maximum cardinal
                    vectors and the minimum/maximum 45 degree vectors.

                <img>
                <p>
                    Along the X and Y-axes, there are [different] cut-offs that separate “Tilt”
                    territory from “Smash” territory. The differences between these territories are
                    not limited to Tilt and Smash attacks, but also actions such as Walk/Dash
                    along the X-axis and Tap Jump/Shield Drop along the Y-axis. X .8000 and
                    Y .6625, the first values that activate Smash on either axis, are pictured
                    above.

                <h2>3.2. 50° Line</h2>
                <img>
                <p>
                    Within the quadrants, there is a 50° Line that distinguishes various actions.
                    Most notably, < 50° territory is useful for angled F-tilt and getting up from
                    the ledge, while > 50° territory is useful for turnaround U-tilt/D-tilt and
                    falling from the ledge.
                </p>
                <img>
                <p>
                    In case you were curious, here is a diagram showing what the Tilt/Smash
                    zones + 50° Line look like when overlapped.

                <h2>3.3. Special Moves</h2>
                <img>
                <p>
                    When your character is grounded, a neutral-B can be performed by pointing
                    in either red territory or the center dead zone, a side-B can be performed by
                    pointing in purple territory, and a vertical-B can be performed by pointing in
                    blue territory.
                </p>
                <img>
                <p>
                    When your character is airborne, neutral-B territory remains the same, but the
                    corners of the coordinate plane are swapped; what was formerly side-B
                    territory becomes vertical-B territory.

                <h2>3.4. Out-of-Shield Options</h2>
                <img>
                <p>
                    When you are shielding, Roll and Spotdodge can be performed by pointing at
                    => .7000 in the appropriate direction. Tap Jump still requires a Smash input
                    along the Y-axis (=> .6625), while Shield Drop requires a very precise Y-axis
                    input of -.6625, -.6750, or -.6875.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If none of these conditions are met, shield can be tilted within the gray area.

                <img>
                <p>
                    On their own (without the use of Modifier X, Modifier Y, or any other button
                    on the B0XX), the 4 analog stick directions will pinpoint 1.0 cardinal vectors
                    and X .7000 Y .7000 (45°) diagonal vectors. This behavior <strong>does not</strong> apply to
                    the 4 C-stick directions (see Section 8.3).
                </p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>4.2. Override</h2>
                <p>
                    The B0XX handles opposite cardinal inputs (i.e. Left → Right) by overriding
                    the previously held direction with the newly chosen direction. It is crucial
                    that the B0XX’s analog stick behaves as such, as this allows the B0XX user
                    to dash-dance (dash left and right quickly) without having to worry about
                    newly chosen directions not being registered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If, however, opposite cardinal inputs are held simultaneously and the most
                    recently chosen direction is released (i.e. Left → Right → release Right), the
                    original direction will <strong>not</strong> reactivate. This system is intended to most closely
                    resemble the act of releasing a Gamecube controller’s analog stick, which
                    would cause it to return to its centerpoint, not the opposite cardinal direction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The behavior described within this section applies to the B0XX’s C-stick
                    (and D-pad; see Section 8.4) as well.

                    Modifier buttons are akin to Shift keys on a keyboard; on their own, modifier
                    buttons won’t produce any inputs, but in conjunction with the 4 analog stick
                    directions, they will adjust your inputs from the ones shown in Section 4.1.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Modifier X, the B0XX’s primary modifier button, is named after its ability to
                    <strong>hug the X-axis within the quadrants.</strong> But before Modifier X’s quadrant
                    modifications are explained, its cardinal modifications will be.

                    Modifier X, the B0XX’s primary modifier button, is named after its ability to

                    modifications are explained, its cardinal modifications will be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When held in conjunction with a horizontal cardinal input, Modifier X will
                    shift you from X 1.0 to X .6625. This coordinate is useful for performing
                    <strong>Walk and F-tilt.</strong> X .6625 also serves as a <strong>slight DI</strong> option for when you are
                    thrown vertically by your opponent.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When held in conjunction with a vertical cardinal input, Modifier X will shift
                    you from Y 1.0 to Y .5375, which provides Y-tilt. Y .5375 is useful for
                    performing <strong>U-tilt and D-tilt.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, within the quadrants, Modifier X’s coordinates of X .7375 Y .3125
                    produce a < 50° angle (23° to be exact), which allows you to perform an
                    <strong>angled F-tilt.</strong> These coordinates also double as <strong>the shallowest Firefox angle
                    on the B0XX,</strong> which will be elaborated on in Section 6.1.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>Advanced:</em> When held in conjunction with both horizontal cardinal directions
                    (Left + Right simultaneously), Modifier X will <em>not</em> cause your X-value to
                    shift from 1.0 to .6625 (it will remain 1.0). Unless you’re an experienced
                    B0XX user, don’t worry about this feature. If you’re an experienced B0XX
                    user... see Section 8.1 for more information.

                    Modifier Y is named after its ability to <strong>hug the Y-axis within the
                    quadrants.</strong> By pinpointing X .3125 Y .7375, Modifier Y allows you to
                    perform <strong>turnaround U-tilt, but only in buffered situations</strong> such as L-
                    cancel lag or wavedash lag (if you press A in conjunction with X .3125

                    When held in conjunction with a horizontal cardinal input, Modifier Y will
                    shift you from X 1.0 to X .3375. X .3375 is primarily intended to serve as
                    <strong>another slight DI option</strong> for when you are thrown vertically by your
                    opponent. Alongside Modifier X’s X. 6625 and the default X 1.0, this makes
                    for 3 evenly spaced out slight DI options.

                    <em>Advanced:</em> Once again, holding <em>both</em> horizontal cardinal directions in
                    conjunction with Modifier Y won’t result in your X-value of 1.0 being
                    modified. See Section 8.1.
